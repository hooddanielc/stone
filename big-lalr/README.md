Big LALR
========

> My LALR parser generator is too slow, and my grammar is too big. Not even NodeJS is fast enough!

Is it? Big LALR is a parser generator written in C++. Big LALR utilizes all platform resources to yield huge goto and action tables in a fraction of the time it would take most dynamically typed languages to produce.
